                    While migrant workers have been an integral part of society that has helped in building our economy through their sweat and tears, they have been discriminated against
                    by Singaporeans, often belitting them for the jobs they perform and avoiding interactions with them. For a multicultural society, how can we do better to protect the interests 
                    of migrant workers who have left their families behind to dedicate their hard work to us?

                Need for Migrant Labour

            <div class="wild">
                <p>Migrant labour is required to fill lower-end jobs in the Manufacturing, Marine and Process or construction industries for Singaporeans with higher qualifications to take on higher-paid PMET jobs 
                  that would help retain Singapore's competitiveness in the economy.</p>
                <p>Many deem the work they do as 3 D work - dirty, dangerous and demeaning. While such a reason for the need of migrant workers reduces them to mere economic actor and 
                  is a demeaning perspective, it shows that we are reliant on their labour and should show appreciation towards them.</p>

                    <p>
                        The negative sentiments portrayed by Singaporean employees towards migrant workers are evident in their harsh and sometimes abusive behaviour towards them. The fear of losing their jobs and being deployed to their home countries leaves these workers with no choice but to withstand such treatment.

                    <p>
                        Transient Workers Count Too, TWC2, and Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics, HOME, are two established non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that offer support to migrant workers. These are the issues that they have dealt with related to migrant workers' mistreatment, that can be found on their respective websites.

                    <p>The high numbers of reported cases show how a significant number of Singaporean employees have failed to show respect and concern for their employees, and in turn created unsafe working conditions for the migrant workers that are under their care.</p>

                        <p>
                            There has been a large-scale <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5435267/" target="_blank">survey</a> done on non-domestic migrant workers to assess their barriers to healthcare and their mental health.

                    <div class="kessler">
                    <p> There is a significant 21.9% of the surveyed migrant workers who are reported to have a Kessler-6 score of 13 or greater, indicating a high likelihood
                        of experiencing severe mental illness. There is an independent association found between <span id="bangladeshi-workers" style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #b74c4c">Bangladeshi workers</span> or workers with <span id="financial-barriers" style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #b74c4c">financial barriers</span>,
                        as represented in the following charts below. This means that Bangadeshi workers or workers with financial burdens are likely to experience psychological distress.

                        According to the same study, there is little access to information about insurance policies for these workers, particularly because the information is
                        not provided in their native language, making it difficult for them to understand. Furthermore, they are unsure if insurance could cover their inpatient and outpatient expenses. 
                        This could prevent them from seeking healthcare when needed. Another reason is because they are afraid that their salary will be on hold even if they
                        are deemed unfit for work through a Medical Certificate (MC), or that they might even lose their jobs. These perceptions could ultimately result in them neglecting
                        their health.

                        Not all hope is lost! There are more non-profit organisations and volunteering groups being set up to support migrant workers with
                        necessities and bridge the gap between Singaporeans and migrant workers. It is thus crucial to speak up on the difficulties encountered by
                        these workers to foster empathy and garner support for this important group of people.
