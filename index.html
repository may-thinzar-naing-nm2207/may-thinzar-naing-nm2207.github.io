                    While migrant workers have been an integral part of society that has helped in building our economy through their sweat and tears, they have been discriminated against
                    by Singaporeans, often belitting them for the jobs they perform and avoiding interactions with them. For a multicultural society, how can we do better to protect the interests 
                    of migrant workers who have left their families behind to dedicate their hard work to us?

                Need for Migrant Labour
            </h3>
            <div class="wild">
                <p>Migrant labour is required to fill lower-end jobs in the Manufacturing, Marine and Process or construction industries for Singaporeans with higher qualifications to take on higher-paid PMET jobs 
                  that would help retain Singapore's competitiveness in the economy.</p>
                <p>Many deem the work they do as 3 D work - dirty, dangerous and demeaning. While such a reason for the need of migrant workers reduces them to mere economic actor and 
                  is a demeaning perspective, it shows that we are reliant on their labour and should show appreciation towards them.</p>

                    <p>
                        The negative sentiments portrayed by Singaporean employees towards migrant workers are evident in their harsh and sometimes abusive behaviour towards them. The fear of losing their jobs and being deployed to their home countries leaves these workers with no choice but to withstand such treatment. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Transient Workers Count Too, TWC2, and Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics, HOME, are two established non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that offer support to migrant workers. These are the issues that they have dealt with related to migrant workers' mistreatment, that can be found on their respective websites.
